            <h1>Welcome to our Webpage!</h1>
            <h3>The Cliffside Park Police Athletic League (PAL) serves as a welcoming community space where students can
                grow, stay active, and feel supported. Designed to be inclusive and encouraging, PAL provides a positive
                environment that brings together fitness, academics, and mentorship for students of all ages.</h3>

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h3>
                PAL offers a completely free gym for all Cliffside Park Middle School and High School students, removing
                financial barriers to staying active and healthy. In addition, PAL places a strong emphasis on academic
                support, providing tutoring services for elementary and middle school students. This tutoring program
                helps students strengthen core subjects, build confidence in their schoolwork, and develop strong study
                habits alongside their physical development.
            </h3>

            <h1>Amenities</h1>
            <h3>The facility is fully equipped with a wide range of fitness equipment, including two bench presses, two
                cable machines, one Smith machine, and two squat racks, along with many other workout stations to
                accommodate different training styles. Students also have access to water stations and vending machines,
                ensuring comfort and convenience during their time at the gym.</h3>

            <h1>Staff</h1>
            <h3>PAL is supported by a dedicated team that helps maintain a safe and respectful atmosphere. Student
                volunteers assist with daily operations and organization, while Police Captain Garramore is consistently
                present to ensure safety, supervise activities, and keep the gym clean, orderly, and welcoming for
